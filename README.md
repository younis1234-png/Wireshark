Wireshark Basics

Wireshark is a network inspection tool - commonly referred to as a traffic, protocol, or packet analyzer. Packet Analysis refers to the process of intercepting network data (packets) and examining those packets to deduce relevant information about their contents

Wireshark is like an X-ray machine for computer networks - and a powerful one at that. Much like how a doctor uses an X-ray machine to see inside a patient’s body, Wireshark provides visibility into a computer network and the packets streaming across it to understand what’s happening at each protocol layer.
