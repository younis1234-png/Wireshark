# Wireshark
Wireshark Basics

Wireshark is a network inspection tool - commonly referred to as a traffic, protocol, or packet analyzer. Packet Analysis refers to the process of intercepting network data (packets) and examining those packets to deduce relevant information about their contents

Wireshark is like an X-ray machine for computer networks - and a powerful one at that. Much like how a doctor uses an X-ray machine to see inside a patient’s body, Wireshark provides visibility into a computer network and the packets streaming across it to understand what’s happening at each protocol layer.

# A Note on Protocols: 
– protocols are just networking languages. Where programs have programming languages for describing their function and behavior (like C, Java, Python), network communications are made possible by networking languages called protocols (like HTTP and IPv4), that dictate how systems communicate with one another. In the technology world, it’s languages all the way down to the wire. All computer systems must agree on a specific way of communicating before they can get anything done; there is no room for creative interpretation. On the bright side, that makes them easy to understand – you just need to know the rules in place. If packets are the words, protocols are the grammar, syntax, and diction.


# Wireshark can be used for a variety of different purposes. To name a few, Wireshark allows:

- Network Engineers to troubleshoot network performance problems.
- Security Analysts to review intrusion attempts and validate internal controls.
- Forensic Analysts to gain insights into security breaches and malware distributions.
- Penetration Testers to search for sensitive information that may give them a foothold in a target network.
